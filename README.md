## Why Learn Java & DSA? 🤔

✅ **Java is Versatile** – Used in web development, mobile apps, and enterprise applications.  
✅ **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Makes code reusable and maintainable.  
✅ **DSA is Essential** – Helps in solving complex problems efficiently.  
✅ **High Demand in Jobs** – Tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft test DSA skills in interviews.

## Installation 🔧

To run Java programs, install **Java Development Kit (JDK)**.

### Install JDK (Windows, macOS, Linux)

- Download and install JDK from **[Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)**
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  java -version
  javac -version
  ```

## Install an IDE (Recommended)

You can write Java code using:

- [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) <br>
- [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) <br>
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with Java extensions

## Running Java Programs ▶️

After writing a Java program, compile and execute it using:

```java
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

**Example:**

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java with DSA!");
    }
}
```
